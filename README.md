CS230 - The Gaming Room


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    ****The Gaming Room is our client for this semesters project. This client wanted to put together a game the emulates 
    a basic form of the popular board game Pictionary. The image base is a single file directory that holds a database of images. The game uses a client/server model to             accomplish this goal. The server will host the web application, and the clients will be able to compete with eachother in groups and teams. The Gaming Room made note to         keep the budget as low as possible.
    
    ****I think I excelled at most parts of this documentation. The portion I excelled at most were the final recommendations in project 3.
    
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    **** The flowchart with the design document was very integral to helping me develop the code. I am very much a visual learner, and talking code can be a very deep subject. Being able to quickly reference a perfectly laid out visualization in the form of a flowchart very much helped me out.
    
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    ****I would like to go back and revise the table after learning what we did regarding cloud computing in Module 8. I believe a Cloud service might be a viable option for The Gaming Room especially in regards to cost-saving and platform expansion. I'd like to go back and adjust my information accordingly.  
    
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    **** The user experience is possibly themost important aspect in all forms of engineering. You could engineer the most efficient application of all time. If a user has trouble navigating your application, they will give up immediately and move onto something else. A specific example of engineering a user friendly application during this semester was using data validation with user input. The Gaming Room required all user names, and team names to be unique. With no data validation, a user could simply be hung out to dry. A prie example of bad engineering.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    ****I mainly used the client/server model along with singleton implementation. It's very easy to understand the viability of a similar model for nearly any other web application in which clients would be regularly interacting with a central server. I really enjoyed how indepth this course went into things like memory management and virtual file structures. In the past I've worked with simple web applications which would pull from a distributed database, but understading things like file mounting and knowing how to select appropriate operating platforms really opened my eyes in regards to larger scale web applications.
