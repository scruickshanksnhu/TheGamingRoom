CS230 - The Gaming Room


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    ****The Gaming Room is our client for this semesters project. This client wanted to put together a game the emulates a basic form of the popular board game Pictionary. The       image base is a single file directory that holds a database of images. The game uses a client/server model to accomplish this goal. The server will host the web application,     and the clients will be able to compete with eachother in groups and teams. The Gaming Room made note to keep the budget as low as possible.
    
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
